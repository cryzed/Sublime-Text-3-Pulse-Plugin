Sublime-Text-3-Pulse-Plugin
===========================

Plugin for Sublime Text 3 that provides 3 commands accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P that start and stop gradually shifting the current theme's background color, making it appear to pulse to a certain beat.


Notes
-----

The "color_scheme" setting must point to a real file when using the plugin. Sublime Text 3 supports resolving "virtual" paths to theme files contained in archives, these must be manually extracted beforehand.
